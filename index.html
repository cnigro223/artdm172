                <h3 class="career">My career goals:</h3>
                <p class="important">
                    I'm super passionate about diving into graphic design. My ultimate goal is working directly with a
                    bunch of different creatives and artists across various media. I love bouncing ideas around and
                    creating visually stunning stories together. I want to use this collaborative energy to make designs
                    that really connect with people, and hopefully, help build an awesome creative community.
