00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.835
First, get a rock.

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.604
Then, smash the rock.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.541
Now, you've got 98%
concentrated silicon dioxide.

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.760
Now, purify it to 99.

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:11.512
9% pure silicon dioxide.

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:15.240
Purify it to 99.

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:16.950
99999999% polysilicon metal.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.553
Put the polysilicon
ingots into a crucible.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.957
Heat the silicon ingots to 1,
698 degrees Kelvin.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.928
Take a small seed monocristal
and dip it into the vat of multi-silicon.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.197
Slowly pull the crystal out as it cools.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.500
Now, you've got a monocristal
of pure silicon.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.304
Next, cut the monocristaline silicon ingot
into thin slices.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.574
Now, you've got pristine,
freshly-cut silicon wafers.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.680
Dope it with some boron or phosphorus.

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:44.080
Put photoresist on the wafer.

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:48.240
Take your chromy anium etched
photolithographic quartz mask and shine

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:50.610
a laser beam through it onto the wafer.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.755
The shadows produced by the photo mask
will control the location of highly

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:59.092
localized chemical reactions
on the surface of the silicon wafer.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.261
Now, develop the photoresist.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.497
Acid etch the exposed parts of the wafer.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.532
Wash away the leftover photoresist.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.640
Now do some homoepitaxy,
heteroepitaxy, pseudoepitaxy,

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:12.472
diffusion doping, copper interconnects.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.775
Chemical mechanical polishing.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:18.090
Now you've got a finished silicon wafer.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.250
Cut your silicon wafer into pieces.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.885
Now you've got unpackaged silicon dies.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:30.958
Locate the pads on the silicon chip
and attach bond wires, or use the method.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.080
The bond wires provide an electrical
connection between the pins on the chip

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:38.365
package and the pads on the silicon die.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.840
And that's how you make a.
